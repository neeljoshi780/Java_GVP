/*(8).Write a program to implement Matrix and inverse, transpose, additions, subtraction, multiplications, and other relevant operations. Define a class â€˜Matrix' with
1) private variables for storing a Matrix (2-dimensional double type array)
2) private variables for storing no. of rows and no. of columns
3) Constructors for initializing member variables and for allocating the 2D array (Note:-implement all possible constructors)
4) Methods to transpose Matrix
5) Methods to add 2 matrices and return the result Matrix object :public Matrix add(Matrix m1) and public Matrix addition(Matrix m1, Matrix m2)
6) Method to subtract 2 matrices and return the result Matrix object : public Matrix sub(Matrix m1) and public Matrix subtraction(Matrix m1, Matrix m2)
7) Method to multiply 2 matrices and return the result Matrix object : public Matrix mul(Matrix m1) and public Matrix multiplication(Matrix m1, Matrix m2)
8) Override toString() method to print the Matrix row-by-row: public String toString()
9) Define one more class with 'main()' function. Define 2 objects m1 and m2 of class Matrix in main(). Get the no. of rows, columns, and values for both the matrices from the user and initialize them by calling
the constructor. Perform all operations (inverse,transpose etc.). Also perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations on matrices m1 and m2. (You can define additional Matrix objects to hold the
results of these operations). Finally, print the result Matrix using the toString() method.*/
